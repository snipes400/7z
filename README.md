# Git archive of 7-zip releases

Because 7-zip [doesn't](https://github.com/7z) have a public repository, and their code is released only as archives on SourceForge, I maintain a git-ified copy here.

The [tagged releases](https://github.com/pornel/7z/releases) and the [original branch](https://github.com/pornel/7z/tree/original) contain pure 7-zip releases, without any modifications like this readme.
